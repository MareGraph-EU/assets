https://aphia.org/ns/traits/cytomorphology#,collection,,,"This trait describes whether or not an organism is unicellular. For algae, this means the relationship between cell structure and thallus organisation. Examples include uninucleate unicellular organisms, multicellular thalli composed of uninucleate cells, multicellular thalli composed of multinucleate cells, and macroscopic thalli composed of a single giant tubular cell (siphonous or acellular thalli).",,,,https://aphia.org/ns/traits/cytomorphology#coenocytic,,
