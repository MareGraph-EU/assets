https://aphia.org/ns/traits/iucn_red_list_category#extinct_in_the_wild,concept,https://aphia.org/ns/attribute-trait/Trait,,"A taxon is Extinct in the Wild when it is known only to survive in cultivation, in captivity or as a naturalized population (or populations) well outside the past range. A taxon is presumed Extinct in the Wild when exhaustive surveys in known and/or expected habitat, at appropriate times (diurnal, seasonal, annual), throughout its historic range have failed to record an individual. Surveys should be over a time frame appropriate to the taxon's life cycle and life form.",,Extinct in the Wild,https://aphia.org/ns/traits/
https://aphia.org/ns/traits/iucn_red_list_category#conservation_dependent,concept,https://aphia.org/ns/attribute-trait/Trait,,"Taxa which are the focus of a continuing taxon-specific or habitat-specific conservation programme targeted towards the taxon in question, the cessation of which would result in the taxon qualifying for one of the threatened categories above within a period of five years. (Note: The conservation dependent category is part of the IUCN 1994 Categories & Criteria (version 2.3), which is no longer used in evaluation of taxa, but persists in the IUCN Red List for taxa evaluated prior to 2001, when version 3.1 was first used. Using the 2001 (v3.1) system these taxa are classed as near threatened, but those that have not been re-evaluated remain with the 'conservation dependent' category.)",,Conservation Dependent,https://aphia.org/ns/traits/
https://aphia.org/ns/traits/iucn_red_list_category#data_deficient,concept,https://aphia.org/ns/attribute-trait/Trait,,"A taxon is Data Deficient when there is inadequate information to make a direct, or indirect, assessment of its risk of extinction based on its distribution and/or population status. A taxon in this category may be well studied, and its biology well known, but appropriate data on abundance and/or distribution are lacking. Data Deficient is therefore not a category of threat. Listing of taxa in this category indicates that more information is required and acknowledges the possibility that future research will show that threatened classification is appropriate. It is important to make positive use of whatever data are available. In many cases great care should be exercised in choosing between DD and a threatened status. If the range of a taxon is suspected to be relatively circumscribed, and a considerable period of time has elapsed since the last record of the taxon, threatened status may well be justified.",,Data Deficient,https://aphia.org/ns/traits/
https://aphia.org/ns/traits/iucn_red_list_category#least_concern,concept,https://aphia.org/ns/attribute-trait/Trait,,"A taxon is Least Concern when it has been evaluated against the criteria and does not qualify for Critically Endangered, Endangered, Vulnerable or Near Threatened. Widespread and abundant taxa are included in this category.",,Least Concern,https://aphia.org/ns/traits/
https://aphia.org/ns/traits/iucn_red_list_category#endangered,concept,https://aphia.org/ns/attribute-trait/Trait,,"A taxon is Endangered when the best available evidence indicates that it meets any of the criteria A to E for Endangered (see Section V), and it is therefore considered to be facing a very high risk of extinction in the wild.",,Endangered,https://aphia.org/ns/traits/
https://aphia.org/ns/traits/iucn_red_list_category#extinct,concept,https://aphia.org/ns/attribute-trait/Trait,,"A taxon is Extinct when there is no reasonable doubt that the last individual has died. A taxon is presumed Extinct when exhaustive surveys in known and/or expected habitat, at appropriate times (diurnal, seasonal, annual), throughout its historic range have failed to record an individual.
