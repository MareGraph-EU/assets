https://aphia.org/ns/traits/feeding_method#kleptovore,concept,"Feeding type specifically for Nemertea species that live inside bivalves and steal part of the food that has been filtered by the bivalve. Note that this is different from kleptoparasitism, where the female searches out the prey or stored food of another female, usually of a different species, and takes it for her own offspring (Lawrence, 2005).

https://aphia.org/ns/traits/feeding_method#facultative_filter_feeder,concept,"Facultative suspension feeder. Some species (e.g. polychaetes Nereis diversicolor and Pygospio elegans, gastropods Valvata piscinalis and Viviparus viviparus, bivalve Macoma balthica, etc) are known to use more than one feeding mode, e.g. to get particles from the water column (by filtering or using mucus nets) and also collect detritus from the surface of the bottom sediments (Fauchald and Jumars 1979; Kuznetzov 1980; Tsikhon-Lukanina 1987). These species were defined as “facultative suspension-feeders” to distinguish them from those which exclusively suspension-feed, i.e. “obligatory suspension-feeders”, such as the bivalve Mytilus edulis trossulus, the barnacle Balanus improvisus or the bryozoan Electra crustulenta.",,,,https://aphia.org/ns/attribute-trait/Trait,https://aphia.org/ns/traits/,https://aphia.org/ns/traits/feeding_method#filter_feeder,Facultative filter feeder
