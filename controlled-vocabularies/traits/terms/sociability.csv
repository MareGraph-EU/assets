https://aphia.org/ns/traits/sociability#colonial,concept,https://aphia.org/ns/traits/,"In biology, a colony is composed of two or more conspecific individuals living in close association with, or connected to, one another. This association is usually for mutual benefit such as stronger defense or the ability to attack bigger prey. It is a cluster of identical cells (clones) on the surface of (or within) a solid medium, usually derived from a single parent cell, as in bacterial colony. [Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colony_(biology)]. Organisms that live together in large numbers, esp. where the individual organisms form part of a larger structure. Examples are some algae, soft corals, reef-building corals, gorgonians and other anthozoans, and siphonophores.
