Development at the expense of internal resources (i.e. yolk) provided by the female (Barnes et al., 1993).

https://aphia.org/ns/traits/development#indirect_development,concept,,,Indirect development,https://aphia.org/ns/traits/,"Most animal species are indirect developers whose life cycle includes a larval stage with characteristics very different from those of the adult organism, which emerges only after a period of metamorphosis (Gilbert & Barresi, 2016). In indirect development, the embryonic phase generates an intermediate larva, and the post-embryonic phase generates an adult by substantial transformation and replacement of larval tissues (Arenas-Mena, 2010).",,https://aphia.org/ns/attribute-trait/Trait
https://aphia.org/ns/traits/development#direct_development,concept,,,Direct development,https://aphia.org/ns/traits/,"Type of heterochronous development in which the embryo abandons the larval stages of development and proceeds directly to adult stage (Henderson's Dictionary of Biology; Lawrence, 2005). Animals (including humans) whose young are essentially smaller, less sexually mature, versions of the adult are referred to as direct developers (Gilbert & Bareesi, 2016). The embryos of directly developing organisms generate at once a juvenile already possessing the complete adult body plan, which then grows and acquires sexual maturity (Arenas-Mena, 2010).",,https://aphia.org/ns/attribute-trait/Trait
