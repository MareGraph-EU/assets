# Top-level ontology of the APHIA ontology network

This is the top-level ontology of the APHIA network of ontologies. It imports Dolce Ultra Light (DUL) and d0 well-known foundational ontologies and adds additional classes and properties necessary for the overall APHIA network.

The latest directory includes always the latest version of the ontology.

The ontologies have been developed in the context of the Work Package 3, coordinated by Italian National Research Council (CNR), of the EU-funded MAREGRAPH project coordinated by VLIZ.
