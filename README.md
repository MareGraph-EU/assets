# Public review for WoRMS Ontologies

We are excited to announce the launch of the **public review** for the first set of ontologies developed within the MAREGRAPH project! These ontologies aim to represent the rich data offered by the [World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS)](https://www.marinespecies.org/) in a standardized and machine-readable format.

We encourage all interested parties to participate in this review.

In particular, we have set up an issue template you can use to [submit specific issues](https://github.com/MareGraph-EU/assets/issues) you may encounter with the ontologies. In the template there is also a reference to the [project deliverable](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10849372) where some motivations and background for design choices are reported.

The public review period will be open until the **30th of June 2024**. We encourage you to submit your contributions as soon as possible to ensure they are considered during the finalization process.

Looking forward to your feedback!
